        This site is a work in progress at the moment, and philosophically
        speaking, it always will be. Keep an eye on it, though, and from the
        small seed I've planted today (
        <time dateTime='2020-02-11'>11th February, 2020</time>) you'll get to
        see something amazing grow.

        Although I'm a developer by trade, that doesn't do justice to the full
        range of skills I've gathered over the years. I've done digital
        marketing, including email, social media and extensive copywriting; I've
        dabbled in CSS design for ebooks; I've worked shop floors and coffee
        bars, and as well as the customer service and teamwork experience that's
        given me, I make a damn fine cup of coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about everything I do, and I never leave a job half
        finished. If something's worth doing, I'll do it right. I'm big on
        teamwork, and know that it's important to remember that I'm always part
        of something bigger, even when I'm working alone. Finally, while I may
        seem like a serious soul, I'm very silly once you get to know me. Just
        give it a chance.
