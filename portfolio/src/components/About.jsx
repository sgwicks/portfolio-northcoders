      <h2>Who is Sam?</h2>
      <p>
        I've written so many "About Me" pages in my time, not to mention
        personal statements and the like, and I still never know where to begin.
        I'm a Leeds-based student, developer-to-be, copywriter, gamer, cook,
        loving boyfriend and dog owner. Not that I don't like cats, it's just
        that my mum is allergic so it's tough for her to visit if I have them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently on the path to become a developer, a path that I turned
        away from back when I went to university, but that was always in the
        back of my mind. I've had to go through the wilderness a bit to find it
        again, but I'm here now, and that's all that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main language is JavaScript, but I do love to learn new things, and
        I'm sure that whatever language you need me to use, I'll very quickly
        learn and adapt to. I have plenty of professional experience and a
        degree in writing, as well as some experience with HTML and CSS for web
        layout, email marketing and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I play games, watch TV, read history and experiment in
        the kitchen with vegan recipes. Don't worry, I'll only talk to you about
        it if you ask first.

        <a href='portfolio.html'>Project Portfolio</a> to see what I've been up
        to, or just go ahead and <a href='contact.html'>get in touch</a>.
