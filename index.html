        <p>
            This site is a work in progress at the moment, and philosophically speaking, it always will be. Keep an eye on it, though, and you'll get
            to see something amazing grow from the small seed I've planted today (<time datetime="2020-02-11">11th February, 2020</time>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I'm a developer by trade, that doesn't do justice to the full range of skills I've gathered over the years. I've done digital marketing,
            including email, social media and extensive copywriting; I've dabbled in CSS design for ebooks; I've worked shop floors and coffee bars, and as 
            well as the customer service and teamwork experience that's given me, I make a damn fine cup of coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about everything I do, and I never leave a job half finished. If something's worth doing, I'll do it right. I'm big on teamwork,
            and know that it's important to remember that I'm always part of something bigger, even when I'm working alone. Finally, while I may seem like a
            serious soul, I'm very silly once you get to know me. Just give it a chance.
